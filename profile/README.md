## What is Patuli?
Patuli (Pahlawan Tuli) is an Android-based application to learn and communicate sign language using Bisindo gestures with integrated machine-learning. 

## Our Goals

The goal of this application is to provide a tool that can aid in communication for individuals who are deaf or not and who want to learn sign language using Bisindo gestures. Overall, this application has the potential to make a significant impact on the lives of individuals who rely on sign language for communication.

## Our Solutions

The solutions we provide are creating this application which have 3 main features:
- Learning Modules for learning Bisindo consisting of Alphabets, Numbers, and Words.
- Gamification to engage users to be more interactive with the application and increase the spirit of learning.
- Real Time Translation to directly translate detected Bisindo movements so that it can help overcoming the difficulty of communicating with deaf people
